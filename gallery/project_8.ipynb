Two separate phenopype projects are used for better organization (single tooth and multiple tooth per images). All images are kindly provided by Ole Seehausen."

The challenges here lie in preventing unwanted objects from being detected (e.g. the checkered paper). In this case, the easiest way is to draw a rectangle mask around the object. Furthermore, the scale bar needs to be measured in every image because it varies in size between images. This is because the microscope software returns non-standardized scale bars that vary between images."
