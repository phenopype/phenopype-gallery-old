    "# Example 7: Measuring worm length\n",
    "\n",
    "Body length is a commonly measured trait. However, live animals are typically not well behaved in front of camera: typically the body is not aligned straight, which makes length measure difficult and sometimes time consuming. Some computer vision can help here, such as skeletonization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_skeleton) for an acurate semi automatic approach, and polyline drawing for a less acurate, manual aproach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I demonstrate how to automatically measure the length of california blackworms (*Lumbriculus variegatus*) in 6 well plates by dragging a mask around them. A future implementation will like include a variant of [Hough transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform) to automatically detect the circles of the wellplates for a full automatic workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For details on the differen workflows (prototyping-, low throughput- and high throughout) see [Tutorial 2](tutorial_2_phenopype_workflow.ipynb). Not all examples include the prototyping workflow."
