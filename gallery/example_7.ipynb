    "\n",
    "Body length is a commonly measured trait. However, live animals are typically not well behaved in front of camera: typically the body is not aligned straight, which makes length measure difficult and sometimes time consuming. Some computer vision can help here, such as skeletonization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_skeleton) for an acurate semi automatic approach, and polyline drawing for a less acurate, manual aproach.\n",
